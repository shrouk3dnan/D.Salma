The procedure can slim hips and thighs, flatten the abdomen, shape the calves and ankles, or eliminate a double chin. These localized fat deposits typically do not respond to diet or exercise. While it is possible to undergo lipoplasty at almost any age, best results will be obtained if the skin still has enough elasticity to achieve a smooth contour following fat removal. Lipoplasty can be performed on several areas of the body at the same time and can also be combined with other aesthetic plastic surgery. Fat is removed by inserting a small, hollow tube, called a cannula, through one or more tiny incisions near the area to be suctioned.

                        Your surgeon  uses liposuction to remove fat from other areas of your body, such as your hips, stomach, and thighs. Liposuction itself involves making incisions in the skin, and then using a tube to remove fat from the body. The fat stores that have just been removed from your body are purified and readied for injection into your buttocks. Your surgeon finishes by injecting the processed fat into specific areas of the buttocks to create a more rounded, full look, three to five incisions are made around the buttocks for fat transfers.
                        Both liposuction and fat transfer incisions are closed up with stitches. Your surgeon then applies a compression garment against the affected areas of skin to minimize your risk of bleeding.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Anesthesia :<br/>

                        Procedure :<br/>
                        With this procedure a soft, shaped silicone implant is placed through an incision hidden inside the natural buttock crease, or an alternate incision site may be used. Your plastic surgeon will provide further details about these incision locations during the consultation.
                        The implant is positioned in a pocket below the large buttock (gluteal) muscle and above the pelvic bone. The incisions are closed with sutures, drains are inserted, and a compression garment is worn following surgery.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Anesthesia :<br/>

                        procedures are labial reduction ('labiaplasty') and vaginal tightening ('vaginoplasty') operations. Other procedures include liposuction to the mons pubis; fat injections to the labia majora or mons in order to give a more youthful appearance to these areas; removal or reduction of skin around the clitoris ('hoodectomy'), to improve clitoral sensitivity; and reconstruction of the hymen for cultural reasons. Laser therapy has been described for the removal of labial wrinkles; and hair transplantation for hypotrichosis of the mons pubis.

                        <br/><br/>
                        <h5>Body reconstruction after tumour resection</h5>
                        Procedure :<br/>
                        Surgeons use tissue from a nearby area to cover the damaged area. The tissue stays attached to your body's blood supply. This can speed up healing and also reduce scarring.<br/>
                        Patient might receive an artificial body part, or implant. For example, implants are available for a breast, testicles, or penis that has been removed as part of cancer treatment.<br/><br/>

                        Recovery :<br/>
                        The time you need to recover depends on the type of surgery. Before surgery, be sure to know that it is possible you will need to make some permanent changes.<br/>
                        <br/><br/>

You may choose to have reconstructive surgery to replace the breast with an implant. Or you might have tissue or nerves removed during treatment for head and neck cancer, skin cancer, or other types of cancer.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <h5>Breast augmentation</h5>

Risks The implants may need to be removed and/or replaced to treat problems including: deflation, implant rupture, the formation of scar tissue around the implant (capsular contracture), which may cause the breast to feel tight or hard, bleeding and/or infection.

                        <br/><br/>
                        Other risks :<br/>
                        Increase or decrease in sensitivity of the nipples or breast skin, which occasionally may be permanent.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Recovery :<br/>
                        The patient can return to work within a few days. She should avoid any physical contact with breasts (excluding her bra) for approximately three to four weeks. Scars should fade and flatten anywhere from three months to two years after surgery, depending upon how an individual heals.

                        Temporary bruising, swelling, numbness, soreness, and/or a burning sensation are possible.<br/><br/>

                        Risks :<br/>
                        Infection, fluid build-up, injury to the skin, rippling or looseness of the skin, asymmetry, pigmentation changes, excessive scarring if tissue was cut away, loss of nipple sensation, contour irregularities and in some instances the need for a second procedure to remove additional tissue is required.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Recovery :<br/>
                        The patient may go back to work after seven days. More strenuous activity may be resumed after two to three weeks. Most of the swelling and bruising will disappear after three to six months.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Results :<br/>
                        They are permanent, although weight gain may cause the breast area to once again become larger.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h5>Female breast reduction</h5>
                        Procedure :<br/>
                        Breast reduction is a procedure designed to remove excess breast tissue and skin in order to relieve physical discomfort associated with very large breasts. The pigmented skin surrounding the nipple (areola) may be reduced and repositioned.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Length :<br/>
                        The procedure usually takes two-three hours to perform.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Anesthesia :<br/>
                        General anesthesia (patient is asleep during the procedure) is usually given.<br/><br/>

                        Hospital Stay :<br/>
                        Patient is usually discharged from the hospital the same day, but hospital stay can be prolonged if required.<br/><br/>

                        Risks :<br/>
                        As with other surgical procedures bleeding, infection or reaction to anesthesia can occur. Also, numbness of nipple or areola, impaired blood supply to the nipples with nipple loss, inability to breastfeed, asymmetry in nipple and breast size, shape. Your body image will be altered and it may take some time to adapt to the new image.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h5>Breast implant reconstruction</h5>
                        Procedure :<br/>
                        Implants are inserted underneath the skin or chest muscle following the mastectomy. (Most mastectomies are performed using a technique called skin-sparing mastectomy, in which much of the breast skin is saved for use in reconstructing the breast.)
                        In the first stage, the surgeon places a device, called a tissue expander, under the skin that is left after the mastectomy or under the chest muscle . The expander is slowly filled with saline during periodic visits to the doctor after surgery.
                        In the second stage, after the chest tissue has relaxed and healed enough, the expander is removed and replaced with an implant. The chest tissue is usually ready for the implant 2 to 6 months after mastectomy.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Considerations :<br/>
                        May not be an option for patients who have previously undergone radiation therapy to the chest, may not be adequate for women with very large breasts.<br/>
                        The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that women with silicone implants undergo periodic MRI screenings to detect possible “silent” rupture of the implants.<br/><br/>

                        Results :<br/>
                        Will not last a lifetime; the longer a woman has implants, the more likely she is to have complications and to need to have her implants removed or replaced. Also, the silicone implants may feel more natural than saline implants to the touch.
                        <br/><br>
                        <h5>Correction of Previous Cosmetic Procedures</h5>


                        The procedure can fix other physicians’ botched work. Corrective or reconstructive surgery that is specialised in fixing cosmetic surgery procedures with poor results.<br/>
                        Corrective surgical procedures help patients by permanently restoring areas of the face and body, Corrective surgical procedures such as ear pinning, mole removal, and scar or rhinophyma revision can offer patients a renewed sense of self.

                        Procedure :<br>
                        Lipoplasty, also called liposuction and suction-assisted lipectomy, removes deposits of excess fat from specific areas of the body including the face and neck. The procedure can slim hips and thighs, flatten the abdomen, shape the calves and ankles, or eliminate a double chin. These localized fat deposits typically do not respond to diet or exercise. While it is possible to undergo lipoplasty at almost any age, best results will be obtained if the skin still has enough elasticity to achieve a smooth contour following fat removal. Lipoplasty can be performed on several areas of the body at the same time and can also be combined with other aesthetic plastic surgery. Fat is removed by inserting a small, hollow tube, called a cannula, through one or more tiny incisions near the area to be suctioned.

                        <br/>
                        Each pulse of the laser takes a fraction of a second and can treat many hairs at the same time. The laser can treat an area approximately the size of a quarter every second. Small areas such as the upper lip can be treated in less than a minute, and large areas, such as the back or legs, may take up to an hour.
                        <br/><br/>

                        <h5>Palomar fractional skin resurfacing</h5>

                        <p>About fractional laser technology</p>

                        The Palomar Lux1540 Fractional™ laser is the latest generation in skin resurfacing technology. The Palomar™ fractional laser smooths fine lines and wrinkles, improves skin discoloration as well as offers mild skin tightening, but without the downtime or mild to moderate redness associated with other skin resurfacing technologies.
                        <br/>
                        The Palomar™ laser and the Fraxel® laser work in a similar way, by treating only a portion of the targeted skin at a time. The Palomar Lux1540 Fractional™ laser delivers light in an array of microbeams to the skin. These microbeams penetrate well below the epidermis and into the dermis, sparing the tissue surrounding the beams from damage. The tissue within these beams initiates a natural healing process that accelerates the formation of new, healthy tissue and the fractional treatment of the skin allows for faster healing with visible results in skin color, texture, tone, fine lines and wrinkles.
                        <br/>
                        Palomar™ fractional skin resurfacing treatments are effective only when performed in a series of sessions because each session treats only 20 to 25 percent of the skin. By treating just a percentage of the skin, the surrounding untreated skin drives the healing process, filling in the treated area with healthy, more youthful looking skin. The “fractional” treatment of the skin creates seamless, radiant skin without the unwanted side effects associated with other skin resurfacing technology.

                        Fractional skin resurfacing is ideal for acne scars, blemishes, discolorations (melasma), texture smoothing and pore reducing.
                        <br/><br/>
                        After laser treatment some skin tightening also occurs but this effect is very small compared to face lift.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Procedure details :<br/>
                        Multiple passes of the laser are usually required. Procedure is usually well tolerated but in some cases anesthetic cream can be used.
                        <br/><br/>
                        <h5>Length of the procedure is usually 30 minutes.</h5>

                        Side effects :<br/>
                        Your face will be red and swollen for a couple of days. It is very important to follow a postoperative regime. Sun and heat exposure must be avoided in a few days after the procedure and sunblock cream must be used for a long time.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Risks :<br/>
                        Procedure is usually without complications but in some cases hyperpigmentation of the skin can occur, especially after exposure to sun and/or heat immediately after the procedure or not following the postoperative regime.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Effects :<br/>
                        Effects after laser resurfacing are permanent.
